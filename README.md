<h2><a class="anchor" id="tools"></a>üõ†Ô∏èProgramming Tools</h2>

PDFShrinker has been written entirely in **Python**. The graphical user interface has been developed using **PySide6** and **QTDesigner**. The binaries  have been built using **PyInstaller**. 

<h2><a class="anchor" id="tools"></a>üì¶ Packaging Binaries</h2>

To build the executable/binary yourself, the general steps are (same for Windows and Linux):
1. Install *Ghostscript* (It is assumed that ***python3*** is already installed).
2. Copy the _src folder_ (which contains pdfshrinker.py and the icons folder) on your machine and open the *pdsfshrinker.py* file in an IDE like VS Code (or PyCharm etc).
3. You can create a .venv if you like for this project. 
3. Install pyside6 (pip install pyside6) and run the python file (python pdfshrinker.py) --> the app should start. 
4. Finally to get the binary install pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller)
5. Run pyinstaller on the pdfshrinker (pyinstaller psdfshrinker.py)
6. The _dist_ folder will have the executable (pdfshrinker). 
7. In case you find that the icons in the app are missing, open the _pdfshrinker.spec_ in a text editor ( nano, notepad++, notepad etc.) and make sure that you have the following line in the analysis block of the _pdfshrinker.spec_ file (replacing datas=[ ]):<BR>
 datas=[('icons', 'icons')],
8. You can then re-run pyinstaller with the spec file (pyinstaller pdfshrinker.spec) to update the build in the _dist_ folder. 
9. You can start the app by clicking on the _pdfshrinker application_ inside the dist folder.
